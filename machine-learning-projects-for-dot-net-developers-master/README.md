# Machine Learning Projects for .Net Developers

This repository is the companion to the book
["Machine Learning Projects for .NET Developers"](http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Projects-NET-Developers/dp/1430267674).
It contains the source code discussed in the book. If you have questions,
comments, or want to report errors, I also set up a [Google Group forum]
(https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/machine-learning-projects-for-dotnet-developers).
Hope you enjoy the book, and... feel free to ping me as

hate the book, let the world know what you think, and add your review to Amazon
